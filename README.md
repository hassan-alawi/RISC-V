# Multi-Cycle 32-bit RISC-V CPU

<h3 style="color:salmon"> About This Repository </h3>

The goal of this repository is to maintain a record of:

1. Development of a pipelined multi-cycle RISC-V core
2. Development of framework/interface to core to be used by other projects

<h3 style="color:navy"> Where to Find Everything </h3>

- If you are intrested in seeing the source files for the basic and experimental blocks, go to `RISC-V.srcs/sources_1/new/`
- You can find a description of each block and its status, as either `verified` or `dev`, below

<h3 style="color:navy"> Block Descriptions </h3>

- ALU:                dev
- register_file:      dev
- control:            dev
- PC:                 dev
